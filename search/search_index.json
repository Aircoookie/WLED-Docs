The disadvantage is higher complexity (you need several PINs for a digital signal). For proper trouble-free operation keep wires between the microphone and ESP32 as short as possible and solder them properly.</p> <p></p> <p>There are also some commercial controllers with integrated digital microphone or plug-in capability available.

The quality is not the best here either because the ESP32 ADC is not particularly good at converting audio signals and the signal conditioning circuitry is very simple, but not very good. In addition, the sensitivity can be quite poor, so that the whole thing only works at a higher volume of the signal.</p> <p></p> <p>In some cases, you can do it without this circuit and connect the GND of the audio source and an audio channel (left or right) directly to ESP32 ADC Pin (GND and analog input, e.g. GPIO36 pin on the ESP32).

In this case, the whole thing works like with a digital I2S microphone. The only difference to I2S microphone is that you at least need an extra PIN for MCLK (Master Clock) signal, which can only be generated by the ESP32 on GPIOs 0, 1 or 3. The other complication is that MCLK is a high frequency signal and must be wired extremely accurate and have short wires. Some adapter types also require more additional signals. For stability it is better to use ready-to-use controller with special Line-In to I2S adapter or DIY PCB design where you can integrate general analog-to-I2S adapter directly without long wires.</p> <p></p> <p>For some more details please refer to Sound Reactive WLED WIKI</p>"},{"location":"advanced/audio-reactive/#software-required","title":"Software required","text":"<p>Because audio reactive capability is currently implemented as a usermod, you need WLED compiled with this usermod included or use Sound Reactive WLED fork.

Over long distances (&gt; 5m) keeping those signals \"clean\" and well defined for the LED they're meant to drive can be difficult.  While there are many methods used to get good results over 10m and longer runs (in-line resistors, voltage boosters, sacrificial pixels, etc.) they are often problematic and unreliable. There is a method specifically designed to send high speed (~1Mhz) TTL data over long (10's to 100's of meter) distances: using a differential pair.</p> <p>Commonly known as RS485, differential pair transmission for LED's takes the single data line from your MCU (ESP32, ESP8266, etc) and translates that into a differential signal that is sent across two wires instead of one.  A transmitter unit (Tx) at the MCU takes in the single data signal and outputs 2 lines usually called A+ and B-.  At the LED strip a matching receiver unit (Rx) takes the A+, B- signals as inputs and outputs clean and accurate 5V LED data that can directly feed the strip.  The only thing that needs to connect the TxRx pair is a pair of wires and a common ground.  The wires don't carry much current at all (~50mA) and can often be a light wire pair from a length of Cat5e or 22/4 alarm wire.</p> <p></p> <p>The distance between the Tx and Rx devices can easily be 30m.  With Cat5e UTP wire you can reliably reach 150m or more.</p> <p>Note, there is no need for a level shifter with the Tx module.  Typical transmitters are spec'd for a minimum 2.4V High level input which is well within the output range of a 3.3V MCU. The only other thing to note about the TxRx pair is that they usually require 5V to operate and often have a 120 ohm termination resistor across the A+,B- connections. Those resistors are important to maintain the integrity of the transmitted data.</p> <p>A TxRx pair can also be used in the middle of a run of LED's when the distance to the next strip is long.  Just put a Tx unit at the end of the first strip and the Rx unit at the start of the next strip.</p> <p>The individual Tx and Rx units are fairly inexpensive and can found on Amazon or via Aliexpress usually for less than $2 USD each (try \"RS485 TTL interface\").</p>"},{"location":"advanced/longdata/#examples-wiring-diagrams","title":"Examples wiring diagrams","text":"<p>Here are basic wiring diagrams for two of the more common TTL-RS485 boards generally found:</p> <p>RS485 board defaults to Tx mode:</p> <p></p> <p>RS485 board defaults to RX (has extra safety components)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"advanced/mapping/","title":"Mapping","text":"<p>WLED now has the ability to remap your LED strip programmatically.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/mapping/#what-is-it","title":"What is it?","text":"<p>This allows us to treat the WLED strip as if it is wired in any way - we can then use the mapping feature to address the strip in any order.

While most people usually worry about the dangers from high voltage, low voltage + high amperage can be dangerous too, as it can easily become a fire hazard in certain circumstances. Depending on your setup size (the number of LEDs you want to drive), use these tips to help guide your wiring.</p> <p>There are plenty of guides out there to help with power supply selection, which is out of scope of this page. Size your power supply to your installation both up and down, so you both provide them with enough current and don't introduce unnecessary risk. It's better to power 30 LEDs from a 10W (2A @5V) power supply than a 100W power supply, as you don't need to worry about the potential for as much energy flowing through small wires.</p> <p>As you increase the number of LEDs, you increase the amps your power supply will need to be able to provide. The more amps you're working with, the more you need to be cautious about your wiring and fusing.</p> <p>For example, if you want to power your LEDs off a sealed lead acid battery (e.g. a car battery), you need to be very careful about current. These kinds of batteries can supply hundreds of amps, so you need to ensure that you use fuses along the way to protect against shorts. If you're using USB pocket chargers on the other hand, they tend to be current limited (most provide only 1-2A max) so you can worry less about fusing there.</p> <p>Make sure to also check out this great list of resources to help you learn!</p>"},{"location":"advanced/wiring/#small-setups-30-rgb-leds","title":"Small Setups (&lt; 30 RGB LEDs)","text":"<p>WLED has a great built-in automatic current-limiting feature, set to 850mA by default. If you have a very small setup (&lt; 30 LEDs), you can use this feature to help simplify your wiring and keep things safe.</p> <p>In most circumstances, it's best to power your LED strip directly from the power supply and wire power to your WLED control board in parallel.</p> <p>{insert diagram here}</p> <p>With the current limiting feature turned on and for very small setups (on the smaller side of 1-30 LEDs), you can power the LED strip directly through the USB port of D1 mini or similar board. That is, power comes in to the control board through the USB port and out to a 5V pin. Each board will be a little different, so it would be wise to verify that you can do this for your specific board. You want to ensure that there are no voltage regulators, diodes, or other components between the 5V pin and the USB port input that are going to be damaged by the high-current draw of the LEDs. You also want to ensure that any PCB traces are big enough that they don't heat up with increased current. Never try to draw more than 1A through a board's USB port like this; the boards really aren't designed for large amounts of current to flow through them.</p> <p>When using this technique, make sure to add strain relief to your wires so that they don't flex and break. The easiest way to do this is to use hot glue. While you want to use plenty of hot glue, just be careful to not cover any components that are going to get hot with hot glue.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/wiring/#medium-setups-30-300-rgb-leds","title":"Medium Setups (30-300 RGB LEDs)","text":"<p>For a medium-sized setup of 30-300 LEDs, you should find a power supply that can provide enough current (see the link above) and make sure to power the strip directly.

This is needed because the LED strips can only pass a small amount of current through them and you need to ensure that all your power-hungry LEDs get fed enough power. If your LEDs are dim or discolored at one end of the strip, you should add power injection.</p> <p>When doing power injection, make sure your wires are rated for the amperage you wish to send over them. You should also check the voltage drop if you're doing a particularly long run. As a rough guide, you should never use anything thinner than 22AWG wire for power injection.</p> <p>For medium-sized setups, you should add fuses if your power supply is over 100W. Considering an inline fuse on each power injection line.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/wiring/#inline-fuses","title":"Inline Fuses","text":"<p>You should place the fuse as close to the power supply as possible, on the positive lead, so that as much of the current flows through it as possible. That will cause the fuse to blow if the power injection line shorts or if the strip shorts, instead of causing your power injection wire or strip to heat up. Buy a fuse that's rated just over what you expect your LED strip to draw. For example, if you calculate that your LEDs will draw at most 4.5A, buy a 5A fuse.</p> <p>First match your power injection wire size with the inline fuse's wire. If the inline fuse comes with 16AWG wire (it's usually printed on the wire itself in small type), you should use 16AWG or thicker wire for your power injection wire. If you use thinner wire, you weaken the utility of the inline fuse and risk your power injection wire heating up in the case of a failure.</p> <p>To wire in an inline fuse, trim back the positive wire (not ground) of your power injection line enough to allow the inline fuse to be spliced in. Place a cut of heat-shrink tubing over the wire so that the cable can be insulated once your solder joint is complete. Strip and bend both wires of your splice so that they create hooks to mechanically reinforce the joint, then solder. Cover with the heat-shrink tubing and you're done!

Loose strands can also cause shorts or break off. The same is true for tinned stranded wires: the solder can deform (especially if it's heated), loosening the screw terminal, and cause a weaker electrical connection or complete failure. That said, untinned stranded wire in a screw terminal actually creates a better connection than tinned stranded wire, so for high current applications where they could possibly heat up, don't tin them if you don't have ferrules.</p> <p>Shrouded wire ferrules also act as strain relief, minimizing mechanical damage if the wire moves at all.

You can connect grounds together, just never the positive rails. This means you need to segment your LEDs based on power supplies, including your power injection. For the same reasons listed below, never connect multiple power supplies to the same strip for power injection purposes, always fork one power supply and route it to the start/mid/end of the same strip.</p> <p>Because multiple power supplies could have subtle variations in their positive voltages (e.g. 12.1V and 12.3V), this could lead to power flowing in ways that aren't expected or which could be damaging to your equipment. In general, wired power supplies don't like to be directly connected to other power supplies unless they are explicitly designed for that purpose.

Again, for safety reasons, you have to protect the area around it: you shouldn't just lay LED strips like that, ideally you should integrate them into aluminum profiles or something similar.

Unlike addressable strips, non-addressable strips require a pin for each \"color\" channel and all LEDs are controlled the same way. To drive these strips, additional circuits (MOSFETs) are required. A basic circuit diagram is shown here. You need one MOSFET and one GPIO per color. It should be noted that the MOSFETs are destroyed very quickly in the event of an overload. To reduce the risk of fire and prevent personal injury, additional circuit elements should be implemented to protect MOSFETs from overtemperature and overload. Depending on the type, fuses are too slow for this! You might consider using self-protected MOSFETs too or the entire MOSFET circuit can be packed into a fire-retardant (e.g. metallic) housing. </p> <p>As of v0.13.1, WLED supports single color, CCT, RGB, RGBW and RGBCCT strips. These strips are commonly found at 12 or 24 volts. The default PWM frequency for dimming is 880 Hz on ESP8266 and 19531 Hz for ESP32. The commercially available so-called RGB(W) LED amplifiers can also be used (also called repeaters/boosters). These typically include optocouplers and MOSFET circuitry (1 to 5 channels) and can be used, for example, as follows: </p> <p>Note that there is no GND connection between the controller and the amplifier. And this despite the fact that with all other WLED circuits it is always said that all GNDs must be connected to each other. This special feature is due to the fact that the inputs of the amplifier are galvanically decoupled from the outputs by optocouplers and the amplifier in this circuit is used slightly differently than its usual application.</p> <p>You can connect the GPIOs directly (3.3V signal level) to the input of the amplifier or, if you use a ready-made WLED controller, you can also use the data outputs (of the level shifter, i.e. 5 V signal level). You can also use both at the same time: </p> <p>The amplifier shown in the picture is a cheap product. Its advantage is a metal case. However, its circuit is very simple: </p> <p>The simple structure means that the duty cycle of the PWM signal (the ratio between pulse and period duration) at the output is slightly distorted compared to the input. In many cases this is not critical, but it does result in the color composition of an RGB strip being slightly distorted. A significantly better (and slightly more expensive) version is described in this article (in German, includes schematics). Here the MOSFETs are controlled with push-pull drivers. This and some other measures in the circuit mean that the PWM signal is reproduced very accurately at the output. There are some other types of LED amplifiers on the market (e.g. MiBoxer RGBW amplifiers and similar ones) that DO NOT work as described above because they require higher input voltage.</p>"},{"location":"basics/compatible-software/","title":"Compatible Software","text":"<p>Still under construction, feel free to add to the list!</p> <p>This page lists some third-party software that can interface with WLED!</p>"},{"location":"basics/compatible-software/#controllers","title":"Controllers","text":"<p>Controllers use the WLED API to change the current light settings.</p> Name Description Home Assistant Versatile and feature rich home automation system.

Even if you split the total amount of LEDs across multiple controllers, your WiFi network could become the limiting factor quickly.

In WLED preferences you have to use GPIO numbers:          The ready-to-use controllers usually have the correct settings printed either on the housing or on the circuit board as in this example:     </li> <li>LED strip with many LEDs is connected and configures, but the current limiter is still at the default value (850 mA). This often has the effect that LEDs either remain dark or flash briefly when the color changes and then go out immediately or light up very dimly. Check and, if necessary, correct the settings in WLED:     </li> <li>Wrong LED type is set. The correct LED type and the correct color sequence (RGB, BGR, etc.) must be set in WLED LED preferences. Check that these settings are correct. You have to know the LED type, but you can simply try out the color sequence to see which is the right one. Special attention must be paid for example to the WS2814 LED strip, which must be set as SK6812 and not as WS281x in the LED preferences.     </li> <li>Wiring is bad. Wiring must be done thoroughly. Loose contacts, cold solder joints etc. must be avoided. You also need to be careful about the correct sizing of the cables: too thin wires can not only cause high voltage drop but also lead to an overheating and fire! For wire sizing you may use this LED power, wiring and fuse calculator. If many power sources are used (for example separate one for ESP and separate one for the LED strip), then all their grounds (GND, V-) must be connected together (but do not connect their V+ together!).</li> </ol>"},{"location":"basics/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","text":"<p>Don't know yet how to solder?

Optionally, the \"win&amp;\" may be omitted. For example, the macro \"A=255\" sets the brightness to maximum. \"R=255&amp;G=160&amp;B=0\" sets the color to orange. You can specify up to 16 macros.

The default pin to which a button can be connected is GPIO 0 (D3 on NodeMCU, D1 Mini and others).  Even though WLED uses the internal pull up resistors on input pins, this pin is ideally externally pulled high to 3.3V with a 10k resistor. The configured macro executes when the pin is pulled low (grounded). The desired macro is entered on the Time/Macros configuration page and then assigned to a short, long or double press. Like this:</p> <p></p> <p>The \"T=2\" macro toggles power to the LEDs (in this case long press). The \"FX=~\" macro steps through the effects (in this case short press).</p> <p>You can set a preset to <code>P1=1&amp;P2=3&amp;PL=~</code>, enter the preset number for your button, and this will step through presets 1 and 3. Change the \"3\" to whatever your highest preset is that you want to include.</p> <p>The default (built-in) actions for button 0 are short-press: toggle on/off and long-press: select random color. Long-pressing for more than 6 seconds will open the WLED-AP with the default password (<code>wled1234</code>).

In case you want to prevent that, you can completely cut power to the LEDs by adding a relay to your circuit. It is toggled by WLED when WLED is turned on/off (in the UI, or through other interfaces). No pin is allocated for a relay by default, but can be easily set in the LED preferences page. Previously, GPIO12 (Pin D6 on many devices) was set as the default and is confirmed to work well on most boards except the ESP32-C3.</p> <p>When you decide that you want WLED to control a relay, make sure you buy a suitable relay board. Check what voltage you can supply from your controller to relay (available 3.3V or 5V pin or different voltage from external power source), and make sure the relay can be controlled by voltage level your board is providing  (3.3V CMOS, 5V TTL). Note, some relays come with a jumper that lets you configure whether the relay switches at high or low level of signal, giving you maximum flexibility.</p> <p>This page gives a clear description using a light bulb instead of a LED strip. And instead of the D1 mentioned there, with WLED, you use the pin you set.</p> <p>The default WLED behavior is to turn the relay pin on (high) when the LEDs are on and off (low) when the LEDs are off. This can be changed in the LED Preferences page. Many relays are powered when the signal is LOW. See this thread.</p> <p>Sometimes people ask whether they can control more than one relay through WLED, including controlling this all via Alexa. Controlling an extra relay separately from the RGB lights is not something WLED is designed to do, however you can modify the code to add that functionality. For that, make sure you can compile WLED from source unmodified first. Then, change #define ESPALEXA_MAXDEVICES 1 in line 71 of the wled.h file to 2. After that, just follow the API documentation on https://github.com/Aircoookie/Espalexa to add a new EspalexaDevice to the alexa.cpp file</p> <p>Second option for controlling multiple relays is using a Multi Relay usermod. As with Alexa you will need to compile WLED from source an include Multi Relay usermod either by including <code>-D USERMOD_MULTI_RELAY</code> in PlatformIO.ini or adding <code>#define USERMOD_MULTI_RELAY</code> in <code>wled.h</code> or <code>my_config.h</code>. You can also override default number of relays by defining <code>MULTI_RELAY_MAX_RELAYS</code>. Configuring usermod is done using Usermod settings page where you can define GPIO pins used, wether relay activates on HIGH or LOW logic, if the activation has any delay and if the relay can be controlled from the outside using MQTT message (external). MQTT topic for controlling relays is <code>wled/[device]/relay/[relay_id]/command</code> and accepts <code>on</code>, <code>off</code> and <code>toggle</code> messages. When the relay changes state a message with <code>on</code> or <code>off</code> is sent with the topic <code>wled/[device]/relay/[relay_id]</code>.</p> <p>How To: Use WLED to switch external relay with PIR sensor without affecting WLED state</p> <p>If you do not want PIR (motion) sensor attached to WLED controller to trigger change of WLED state, but still want to control a legacy light, fan, etc. use the Multi Relay usermod and another relay attached to WLED controller. Create two presets for relay control (shown for switching relay off) and set up PIR and multi relay usermods as shown.</p> <p></p> <p>If you do not want button relay control just leave relay button at -1, the same goes for PIR sensor parameters (leave nighttime-only and/or off-only unchecked). Adjust preset numbers and GPIO pins to your liking. Multi relay usermod can also switch relay using MQTT messages or HTTP requests (check source code for available commands). Of course if you configured MQTT on your WLED device PIR sensor usermod will publish /motion topic to MQTT broker for your HA integration.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"features/segments/","title":"Segments","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>Starting in WLED 0.9.0, Segments are supported.</p> <p>This feature allows you to set different zones on the LED strip, each running a different effect or color.</p> <p>A segment is selected if the checkmark next to the segment number is checked.

Since the default group size is one, the effect normally only changes a single LED. When Grouping is set to two, the effect will light two LEDs using the same color. The two LEDs are treated as a single virtual LED. </p> <p>To illustrate this, we can create a segment with 12 LEDS (physically referred to as LED 0 to LED 11) and select an effect that repeats three colors. When Grouping is set to one we see a repeating pattern of one red LED, one blue LED, and one green LED. When Grouping is set to two the segment of 12 physical LEDs becomes a segment of 6 virtual LEDs (virtualLED 0 to virtualLED 5). The same effect will now set the color of each virtual LED (which consists of two physical LEDs).

When Spacing is set to one the segment of 12 physical LEDs becomes a segment of 6 virtual LEDs (virtualLED 0 to virtualLED 5).

You have to enter the Hardware MAC address of the remote control. This is determined by clicking on any button on the remote control and copying the last received MAC address from the \"Last Seen\" field to the \"Hardware MAC\" field in WLED ESP-NOW settings (\u201cConfig-&gt;WiFi Setup\u201d) and saving it with \"Save\".

Therefore there is no line of sight between the remote control and the WLED controller required, as is the case with an IR remote control.  The 4 buttons \"1\"-\"4\" of the WIZmote remote control are linked to presets 1 to 4. The meaning of other keys is self-explanatory.

If not, see if there is a JSON file for a remote with  the same number of buttons. Often remotes with the same number of buttons have different labels but emit the  same codes. The JSON keys are the hex encoded IR codes emitted by each button.  The keys are strings and case is important,  be sure to use the same format as the sample below. It is also the same format used when codes are echoed on the serial console. </p> <p>In the JSON document, each button object should have a <code>cmd</code> attribute containing the HTTP request or JSON API command.  In addition to HTTP and JSON API commands, several C functions are supported (!incBrightness, !decBrightness, !presetFallback). The !incBrightness and !decBrightness functions, take smaller steps at the dim end of the range with progressively larger steps at the bright end. The !presetFallback function applies a preset (attribute PL) and falls back to the specified effect and palette (attributes FX and FP) if preset does not exist. (see sample below)</p> <p>If an IR remote button is pressed rapidly or held down, subsequent presses have a different code (0xFFFFFFFF).  If your command is repeatable but does not contain the \"~\" character and is not calling incBrightness or decBrightness, then add a \"rpt\" attribute with a value of true.  Label and position attributes are ignored by WLED but useful when making edits. </p> <p>If an ir.json file does not already exist for your remote, you will need to determine what code each button emits. To do this, connect your ESP8266 or ESP32 to a computer and  open Arduino or VSCode serial monitor. Then press each button and record the code printed on the serial monitor. You should see something like this:</p> <pre><code>IR recv\n0xFFDE10\n</code></pre> <p>You should get a 24-bit hex encoded integer. If you get 0xFFFFFFFF, that means the button has been pressed repeatedly or held down. Try tapping quickly.</p>"},{"location":"interfaces/json-ir/json_infrared/#tips","title":"Tips","text":"<ul> <li>Map <code>play</code> or <code>auto</code> buttons to a playlist.
