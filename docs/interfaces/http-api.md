WLED's HTTP API allows you to set many properties of your lights, even more than the index page UI supports, via a simple GET web request.

    _Unsure how all this API stuff works? Check out [this amazing guide](https://tynick.com/blog/01-28-2020/controlling-wled-with-raspberry-pi-using-the-wled-api/) by tynick!_

!!! hint
    While this API is not deprecated, it is highly recommended to use the [JSON API](/interfaces/json-api) instead of the HTTP API for new integrations, as it is structured in a better way and allows efficient use of newer features like segments, presets, and playlists.

The basic URL scheme is: `[ipadress]/win`. This will return an XML file with some current values (see bottom of page).
Parameters can be added to control some of the variables.

- Example (AP): `192.168.4.1/win&A=255` sets the brightness to maximum
- Example (mdns): `led.local/win&A=128&FX=0` sets the brightness to half and the effect to Solid

In conjunction with a [router port forwarding](/advanced/remote-access-ifttt) this can be used to automate WLED, for example via IFTTT.

Add one or multiple of the following parameters after the base URL/IP to change values:
(if the parameter is unknown or the value illegal nothing will happen)

## LED control

## Advanced

| Parameter | Value Range | Description | Since Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
&CL= | HEX/DEC | Primary color | 0.8.0
&C2= | HEX/DEC | Secondary color | 0.8.0
&C3= | HEX/DEC | Third color | 0.8.0
&R2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Red value | 0.4
&G2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Green value | 0.4
&B2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Blue value | 0.4
&W2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary White value | 0.4
&HU= | 0 to 65535 | Hue | 0.5.1

### Use of hex values

Hex values need to be prefaced with the character h or H. The normal format is `RRGGBB`. If the led strip is RGBW, the hex format is `WWRRGGBB`. Note: In the UI the format is `RRGGBBWW`, so the values cannot be copied without a transformation.

### Loxone commands

Loxone offers two commands. One for RGB values and one for brightness and color temperature.

&LX= | 20bbbtttt | 200002700 - 201006500 | Loxone brightness and color temperature values for primary color. Brightness `bbb` is specified in the range 0 to 100%. `tttt` defines the color temperature in the range from 2700 to 6500 Kelvin. | 0.11
&LY= | BBBGGGRRR | 0 - 100100100 | Loxone RGB value for secondary color. Each color (`RRR`,`GGG`,`BBB`) is specified in the range from 0 to 100%. | 0.11

## In-/decrementing values

You can use the `~` character to easily set values relative to their current value.  
This is currently supported for the following parameters:  
`A, R, G, B, W, R2, G2, B2, W2, FX, SX, IX, FP, PL`

For example, use `PL=~` to go to the next preset. Using just `~` without a number will increase the value by 1, `~-` will decrease it by 1. The value will then wrap around, so using `A=~-` when A is 0 will set A to 255.  

You can also specify by how much to change the value. For example, using `A=~10` will increase the brightness by 10. In case of using a number behind `~`, the value will clip (so it will not wrap around, if the maximum brightness is set, `A=~10` will not have any effect)

To setup a Macro for a Button to advance to the next Preset, use **win&P1=1&P2=30&PL=~**  
P1 will equal the first Preset of the rotation while P2 will be the last Preset.
