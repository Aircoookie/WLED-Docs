!!! hint
    While this API is not deprecated, it is highly recommended to use the [JSON API](/interfaces/json-api) instead of the HTTP API for new integrations, as it is structured in a better way and allows efficient use of newer features like segments, presets, and playlists.

WLED's HTTP API allows you to set many properties of your lights, even more than the index page UI supports, via a simple GET web request.

    _Unsure how all this API stuff works? Check out [this amazing guide](https://tynick.com/blog/01-28-2020/controlling-wled-with-raspberry-pi-using-the-wled-api/) by tynick!_

The basic URL scheme is: `[ipadress]/win`. This will return an XML file with some current values (see bottom of page).
Parameters can be added to control some of the variables.

- Example (AP): `192.168.4.1/win&A=255` sets the brightness to maximum
- Example (mdns): `led.local/win&A=128&FX=0` sets the brightness to half and the effect to Solid

In conjunction with a [router port forwarding](/advanced/remote-access-ifttt) this can be used to automate WLED, for example via IFTTT.

Add one or multiple of the following parameters after the base URL/IP to change values:
(if the parameter is unknown or the value illegal nothing will happen)

## Advanced

| Parameter | Value Range | Description | Since Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
&CL= | HEX/DEC | Primary color | 0.8.0
&C2= | HEX/DEC | Secondary color | 0.8.0
&C3= | HEX/DEC | Third color | 0.8.0
&R2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Red value | 0.4
&G2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Green value | 0.4
&B2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary Blue value | 0.4
&W2= | 0 to 255 | Secondary White value | 0.4
&HU= | 0 to 65535 | Hue | 0.5.1

### Use of hex values

Hex values need to be prefaced with the character h or H. The normal format is `RRGGBB`. If the led strip is RGBW, the hex format is `WWRRGGBB`. Note: In the UI the format is `RRGGBBWW`, so the values cannot be copied without a transformation.

### Loxone commands

Loxone offers two commands. One for RGB values and one for brightness and color temperature.

&LX= | 20bbbtttt | 200002700 - 201006500 | Loxone brightness and color temperature values for primary color. Brightness `bbb` is specified in the range 0 to 100%. `tttt` defines the color temperature in the range from 2700 to 6500 Kelvin. | 0.11

## In-/decrementing values

You can use the `~` character to easily set values relative to their current value.  
This is currently supported for the following parameters:  
`A, R, G, B, W, R2, G2, B2, W2, FX, SX, IX, FP, PL`

For example, use `PL=~` to go to the next preset. Using just `~` without a number will increase the value by 1, `~-` will decrease it by 1. The value will then wrap around, so using `A=~-` when A is 0 will set A to 255.  

You can also specify by how much to change the value. For example, using `A=~10` will increase the brightness by 10. In case of using a number behind `~`, the value will clip (so it will not wrap around, if the maximum brightness is set, `A=~10` will not have any effect)

To setup a Macro for a Button to advance to the next Preset, use **win&P1=1&P2=30&PL=~**  
P1 will equal the first Preset of the rotation while P2 will be the last Preset.
