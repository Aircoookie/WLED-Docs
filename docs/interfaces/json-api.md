!!! info "Version Info"
    Starting from version 0.8.4, WLED implements a powerful JSON API over HTTP.
    It is accessible using the `/json` subpage.

### Obtaining light information

Sending a GET request will return an object similar to the sample below
The response consists of four objects:

- `state` contains the current state of the light. All values may be modified by the client (see below)
- `info` contains general information about the device. No value can be modified using this API
- `effects` contains an array of the effect mode names
- `palettes` contains an array of the palette names

You may also obtain those objects individually using the URLs `/json/state` `/json/info` `/json/eff`, and `/json/pal`

### Setting new values

Sending a POST request to `/json` or `/json/state` with (parts of) the state object will update the respective values.
Example: `{"on":true,"bri":255}` sets the brightness to maximum. `{"seg":[{"col":[[0,255,200]]}]}` sets the color of the first segment to teal.

!!! tldr "CURL example"
    This will toggle on and off and return the new state (v0.13+):
    `curl -X POST "http://[WLED-IP]/json/state" -d '{"on":"t","v":true}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"`

Sample JSON API response (v0.8.4):

### Overview of values

#### State object

| JSON key | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
on | bool | On/Off state of the light
bri | 0 to 255 | Brightness of the light. If _on_ is `false`, contains last brightness when light was on (aka brightness when _on_ is set to true. Setting _bri_ to 0 is supported but it is recommended to use the range 1-255 and use `on: false` to turn off. The state response will never havethe value `0` for _bri_.
transition | 0 to 255 | Duration of the crossfade between different colors/brightness levels. One unit is 100ms, so a value of `4` results in atransition of 400ms.
tt | 0 to 255 | Similar to transition, but applies to just the current API call. Not included in state response.
ps | -1 to 65535 | ID of currently set preset.
~~pss~~ | 0 to 65535 | Bitwise indication of preset slots (0 - vacant, 1 - written). Always 0 in 0.11. Not changable. _Removed as of v0.11.1_
psave | 1 to 16 (250 in 0.11) | Save current light config to specified preset slot. Not included in state response.
pl | -1 to 0 | ID of currently set playlist. For now, this sets the preset cycle feature, `-1` is off and `0` is on.
nl.on | bool | Nightlight currently active
nl.dur | 1 to 255 | Duration of nightlight in minutes
~~nl.fade~~ | bool | If `true`, the light will gradually dim over the course of the nightlight duration. If `false`, it will instantly turn to the target brightness once the duration has elapsed. _Removed in 0.13.0_ (use mode instead)
nl.mode | 0 to 3 | Nightlight mode (0: instant, 1: fade, 2: color fade, 3: sunrise) (available since 0.10.2)
nl.tbri | 0 to 255 | Target brightness of nightlight feature
nl.rem | -1 to 15300 | Remaining nightlight duration in seconds, -1 if not active. Only in state response, can not be set.
udpn.send | bool | Send WLED broadcast (UDP sync) packet on state change
udpn.recv | bool | Receive broadcast packets
udpn.nn | bool | Don't send a broadcast packet (applies to just the current API call). Not included in state response.
v | bool | If set to _true_ in a JSON POST command, the response will contain the full JSON state object. Not included in state response
rb | bool | If set to _true_, device will reboot immediately. Not included in state response.
live | bool | If set to _true_, enters realtime mode and blanks the LEDs. The realtime timeout option does not have an effect when this command is used, WLED will stay in realtime mode until the state (color/effect/segments, excluding brightness) is changed. It is expected that `{"live":false}` is sent once live data sending is terminated. Not included in state response.
lor | 0, 1, or 2 | Live data override. 0 is off, 1 is override until live data ends, 2 is override until ESP reboot (available since 0.10.0)
time | uint32 | Set module time to unix timestamp. Not included in state response.
mainseg | 0 to info.leds.maxseg-1 | Main Segment | Sets which segment ID is the main segment. The main segment's values are the ones sent by UDP sync, and in case no segment is selected, all changes done via the `"seg":{}` syntax without a segment `id` specified are applied to the main segment. If the main segment is deleted, the first active segment becomes the new main segment.
seg | Array of segment objects | Segments are individual parts of the LED strip. In 0.9.0 this will enables running different effects on differentparts of the strip.
playlist | object | [Custom preset playlists](#playlists). Not included in state response (available since 0.11.0)

#### Contents of the segment object

**Notice:** _start_, _stop_, and _len_ are not changeable in  0.8.4. Any segment with _id_ > 0 is ignored.
Unless stated otherwise, every value may be changed via an HTTP POST request.
The tertiary color is not gamma-corrected in 0.8.4, but is in subsequent releases.

| JSON key | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
id | 0 to info.maxseg -1 | Zero-indexed ID of the segment. May be omitted, in that case the ID will be inferred from the order of the segment objects in the _seg_ array.
start | 0 to info.leds.count -1 | LED the segment starts at.
stop | 0 to info.leds.count | LED the segment stops at, not included in range. If _stop_ is set to a lower or equal value than _start_ (setting to `0` is recommended), the segment is invalidated and deleted.
len | 0 to info.leds.count | Length of the segment (_stop_ - _start_). _stop_ has preference, so if it is included, _len_ is ignored.
grp | 0 to 255 | Grouping (how many consecutive LEDs of the same segment will be grouped to the same color)
spc | 0 to 255 | Spacing (how many LEDs are turned off and skipped between each group)
of | -len+1 to len | Offset (how many LEDs to rotate the virtual start of the segments, available since 0.13.0)
col | array of colors | Array that has up to 3 color arrays as elements, the primary, secondary (background) and tertiary colors of the segment. Each color is an array of 3 or 4 bytes, which represent an RGB(W) color.
fx | 0 to info.fxcount -1 | ID of the effect or ~ to increment, ~- to decrement, or r for random.
sx | 0 to 255 | Relative effect speed. ~ to increment, ~- to decrement. ~10 to increment by 10, ~-10 to decrement by 10.
ix | 0 to 255 | Effect intensity. ~ to increment, ~- to decrement. ~10 to increment by 10, ~-10 to decrement by 10.
pal | 0 to info.palcount -1 | ID of the color palette or ~ to increment, ~- to decrement, or r for random.
sel | bool | `true` if the segment is selected. Selected segments will have their state (color/FX) updated by APIs that don't support segments (e.g. UDP sync, HTTP API). If no segment is selected, the first segment (_id_:`0`) will behave as if selected. WLED will report the state of the first (lowest _id_) segment that is selected to APIs (HTTP, MQTT, Blynk...), or `mainseg` in case no segment is selected and for the UDP API. Live data is always applied to all LEDs regardless of segment configuration.
rev | bool | Flips the segment, causing animations to change direction.
on | bool | Turns on and off the individual segment. _(available since 0.10.0)_
bri | 0 to 255 | Sets the individual segment brightness _(available since 0.10.0)_

#### Per-segment individual LED control

Using the `i` property of the segment object, you can set the LED colors in the segment using the JSON API.  
Keep in mind that this is non-persistent, if the light is turned off the segment will return to effect mode.  
The segment is blanked out when using individual control, the set effect will not run.   
To disable, change any property of the segment or turn off the light.

To set individual LEDs starting from the beginning, use an array of Color arrays.
`{"seg":{"i":[[255,0,0], [0,255,0], [0,0,255]]}}` will set the first LED red, the second green and the third blue.

To set individual LEDs, use the LED index followed by its Color array.
`{"seg":{"i":[0,[255,0,0], 2,[0,255,0], 4,[0,0,255]]}}` is the same as above, but leaves blank spaces between the lit LEDs.

To set ranges of LEDs, use the LED start and stop index followed by its Color array.
`{"seg":{"i":[0,8,[255,0,0], 10,18,[0,0,255]]}}` sets the first eight LEDs to red, leaves out two, and sets another 8 to blue.

Keep in mind that the LED indices are segment-based, so LED 0 is the first LED of the segment, not of the entire strip.
Segment features, including Grouping, Spacing, Mirroring and Reverse are functional.
This feature is available in build 200829 and above.

!!! info "Brightness interaction"
    For your colors to apply correctly, make sure the desired brightness is set beforehand. Turning on the LEDs from an off state and setting individual LEDs in the same JSON request will _not_ work!

#### Playlists

(Available since 0.11.0)

Sample playlist API call:

```json
{
  "playlist": {
    "ps": [26, 20, 18, 20],
    "dur": [30, 20, 10, 50],
    "transition": 0,
    "repeat": 10,
    "end": 21
  }
}
```

This example applies preset ID 26 for 3 seconds, then preset 20 for 2 seconds, then preset 18 for 1 second, lastly preset 20 again for 5 seconds.This repeats 10 times, then preset 21 is applied.

Playlist object:

| JSON key | Description
| --- | --- |
ps | Array of preset ID integers to be applied in this order.
dur | Array of time each preset should be kept, in tenths of seconds. If only one integer is supplied, all presets will be kept for that time.Defaults to 10 seconds if not provided.
transition | Array of time each preset should transition to the next one, in tenths of seconds. If only one integer is supplied, all presets will transition for that time. Defaults to the current transition time if not provided.
repeat | How many times the entire playlist should cycle before finishing. Set to `0` for an indefinite cycle. Default to indefinite if not provided.
end | Single preset ID to apply after the playlist finished. Has no effect when an indefinite cycle is set. If not provided, the light will stay on the last preset of the playlist.

#### CCT control

Please also see the [general info about CCT](/features/cct).
##### Supported value ranges

Given that the white spectrum handling is agnostic to the true color temperature of the LEDs used, a relative range is preferred for the time being, where a value of `0` indicates the warmest possible color temperature, while a value of `255` indicates the coldest temperature.

It is also possible to pass a value in the range of `1900` to `10091`, in which case it is treated as a Kelvin color temperature, where `1900` is mapped to a relative value of `0` and `10091` to a relative value of `255`.

As such, it is unlikely to match the _actual_ color temperature output by the light, therefore the relative values 0-255 are preferred for the time being.

In the future, an option to specify the Kelvin temperatures of the utilized hardware may be added, once this is done, a color temperature can be set to more accurately match other lights.

Therefore, for forward compatibility, your integration should expect both either a 0-255 value for `seg.cct`, in which case it is a relative value, or an absolute Kelvin value in the range 1000-16000 K. In case a Kelvin value is provided, you can consider the color temperature as accurate, which is not possible with relative 0-255 values as the Kelvin points of the white channels are unknown.  
It is preferred that you set a new CCT value in the same range as received from WLED, that is, use 0-255 if the original value was within this range, and 1000-20000 K otherwise.

If your code relies on absolute Kelvin values, a reasonable estimate for the warm white point (relative `0`) could be 2700K, while cold white (relative `255`) could commonly be 6500K.

##### Effect of the seg.cct value

`seg.cct` can always be set, but only has an effect on the physical state of the light if one or both of the following conditions is met:

- White Balance correction is enabled
- A bus supporting CCT is configured and `Calculate CCT from RGB` is _not_ enabled

CCT support is indicated by `info.leds.cct` being `true`, in which case you can regard the instance as a CCT light and e.g. display a color temperature control.
