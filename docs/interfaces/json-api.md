WLED versions since 0.8.4 implement a powerful JSON API over HTTP.  
It is accessible using the `/json` subpage.

### Obtaining light information

Sending a GET request will return an object similar to the sample below
The response consists of four objects:

- `state` contains the current state of the light. All values may be modified by the client (see below)
- `info` contains general information about the device. No value can be modified using this API
- `effects` contains an array of the effect mode names
- `palettes` contains an array of the palette names

You may also obtain those objects individually using the URLs `/json/state` `/json/info` `/json/eff`, and `/json/pal`.

!!! info "Reserved effect IDs"
    In WLED versions 0.14+, some effects are unsupported in certain builds (e.g. some audio reactive effects may only work on ESP32).
    In order for each effect to have an unique ID on all devices, having unsupported ones in between supported ones is possible.
    If called, these will fallback to the Solid effect, in the effects list they have the name `RSVD` or `-`.
    To improve user experience, it is recommended to remove effects with the names `RSVD` or `-` form the UI effect selection.

### Setting new values

Sending a POST request to `/json` or `/json/state` with (parts of) the state object will update the respective values.
Example: `{"on":true,"bri":255}` sets the brightness to maximum. `{"seg":[{"col":[[0,255,200]]}]}` sets the color of the first segment to teal.
`{"seg":[{"id":X,"on":"t"}]}` and replacing X with the desired segment ID will toggle on or off that segment.

!!! tldr "CURL example"
    This will toggle on and off and return the new state (v0.13+):
    `curl -X POST "http://[WLED-IP]/json/state" -d '{"on":"t","v":true}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"`

Sample JSON API response (v0.8.4):

### Overview of values

#### State object

| JSON key | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
on | bool | On/Off state of the light
bri | 0 to 255 | Brightness of the light. If _on_ is `false`, contains last brightness when light was on (aka brightness when _on_ is set to true. Setting _bri_ to 0 is supported but it is recommended to use the range 1-255 and use `on: false` to turn off. The state response will never havethe value `0` for _bri_.
transition | 0 to 255 | Duration of the crossfade between different colors/brightness levels. One unit is 100ms, so a value of `4` results in atransition of 400ms.
tt | 0 to 255 | Similar to transition, but applies to just the current API call. Not included in state response.
ps | -1 to 65535 | ID of currently set preset. `1~17~` can be used to iterate through presets 1-17.
~~pss~~ | 0 to 65535 | Bitwise indication of preset slots (0 - vacant, 1 - written). Always 0 in 0.11. Not changable. _Removed as of v0.11.1_
psave | 1 to 16 (250 in 0.11) | Save current light config to specified preset slot. Not included in state response.
pl | -1 to 0 | ID of currently set playlist. For now, this sets the preset cycle feature, `-1` is off and `0` is on.
nl.on | bool | Nightlight currently active
nl.dur | 1 to 255 | Duration of nightlight in minutes
~~nl.fade~~ | bool | If `true`, the light will gradually dim over the course of the nightlight duration. If `false`, it will instantly turn to the target brightness once the duration has elapsed. _Removed in 0.13.0_ (use mode instead)
nl.mode | 0 to 3 | Nightlight mode (0: instant, 1: fade, 2: color fade, 3: sunrise) (available since 0.10.2)
nl.tbri | 0 to 255 | Target brightness of nightlight feature
nl.rem | -1 to 15300 | Remaining nightlight duration in seconds, -1 if not active. Only in state response, can not be set.
udpn.send | bool | Send WLED broadcast (UDP sync) packet on state change
udpn.recv | bool | Receive broadcast packets
udpn.nn | bool | Don't send a broadcast packet (applies to just the current API call). Not included in state response.
v | bool | If set to _true_ in a JSON POST command, the response will contain the full JSON state object. Not included in state response
rb | bool | If set to _true_, device will reboot immediately. Not included in state response.
live | bool | If set to _true_, enters realtime mode and blanks the LEDs. The realtime timeout option does not have an effect when this command is used, WLED will stay in realtime mode until the state (color/effect/segments, excluding brightness) is changed. It is expected that `{"live":false}` is sent once live data sending is terminated. Not included in state response.
lor | 0, 1, or 2 | Live data override. 0 is off, 1 is override until live data ends, 2 is override until ESP reboot (available since 0.10.0)
time | uint32 | Set module time to unix timestamp. Not included in state response.
mainseg | 0 to info.leds.maxseg-1 | Main Segment | Sets which segment ID is the main segment. The main segment's values are the ones sent by UDP sync, and in case no segment is selected, all changes done via the `"seg":{}` syntax without a segment `id` specified are applied to the main segment. If the main segment is deleted, the first active segment becomes the new main segment.
seg | Array of segment objects | Segments are individual parts of the LED strip. In 0.9.0 this will enables running different effects on differentparts of the strip.
playlist | object | [Custom preset playlists](#playlists). Not included in state response (available since 0.11.0)
tb | uint32 | Sets timebase for effects. Not reported.

#### Contents of the segment object

**Notice:** _start_, _stop_, and _len_ are not changeable in  0.8.4. Any segment with _id_ > 0 is ignored.
Unless stated otherwise, every value may be changed via an HTTP POST request.
The tertiary color is not gamma-corrected in 0.8.4, but is in subsequent releases.

| JSON key | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
id | 0 to info.maxseg -1 | Zero-indexed ID of the segment. May be omitted, in that case the ID will be inferred from the order of the segment objects in the _seg_ array.
start | 0 to info.leds.count -1 | LED the segment starts at.
stop | 0 to info.leds.count | LED the segment stops at, not included in range. If _stop_ is set to a lower or equal value than _start_ (setting to `0` is recommended), the segment is invalidated and deleted.
len | 0 to info.leds.count | Length of the segment (_stop_ - _start_). _stop_ has preference, so if it is included, _len_ is ignored.
grp | 0 to 255 | Grouping (how many consecutive LEDs of the same segment will be grouped to the same color)
spc | 0 to 255 | Spacing (how many LEDs are turned off and skipped between each group)
of | -len+1 to len | Offset (how many LEDs to rotate the virtual start of the segments, available since 0.13.0)
col | array of colors | Array that has up to 3 color arrays as elements, the primary, secondary (background) and tertiary colors of the segment. Each color is an array of 3 or 4 bytes, which represent an RGB(W) color.

pal | 0 to info.palcount -1 | ID of the color palette or ~ to increment, ~- to decrement, or r for random.
sel | bool | `true` if the segment is selected. Selected segments will have their state (color/FX) updated by APIs that don't support segments (e.g. UDP sync, HTTP API). If no segment is selected, the first segment (_id_:`0`) will behave as if selected. WLED will report the state of the first (lowest _id_) segment that is selected to APIs (HTTP, MQTT, Blynk...), or `mainseg` in case no segment is selected and for the UDP API. Live data is always applied to all LEDs regardless of segment configuration.
rev | bool | Flips the segment, causing animations to change direction.
on | bool | Turns on and off the individual segment. _(available since 0.10.0)_

#### Per-segment individual LED control

Using the `i` property of the segment object, you can set the LED colors in the segment using the JSON API.  
Keep in mind that this is non-persistent, if the light is turned off the segment will return to effect mode.  
The segment is frozen when using individual control, the set effect will not run.   
To unfreeze the segment, click the "eye" icon, change any property of the segment or turn off the light.

To set individual LEDs starting from the beginning, use an array of Color arrays `[255, 0, 0]` or hex values `'FF0000'`. 
Hex values are more efficient than Color arrays and should be when setting a large number of colors.<br>
`{"seg":{"i":['FF0000', '00FF00', '0000FF']}}` <br>or <br>`{"seg":{"i":[[255,0,0], [0,255,0], [0,0,255]]}}` <br>
will set the first LED red, the second green and the third blue.

To set individual LEDs, use the LED index followed by its color value.<br>
`{"seg":{"i":[0,'FF0000', 2,'00FF00', 4,'0000FF']}}` <br>is the same as above, but leaves blank spaces between the lit LEDs.

To set ranges of LEDs, use the LED start and stop index followed by its color value. <br>
`{"seg":{"i":[0,8,'FF0000', 10,18,'0000FF']}}` <br>sets the first eight LEDs to red, leaves out two, and sets another 8 to blue. Note that the **stop** index should be the first LED **after** the range. So if you want to set LEDs 1, 2, and 3, your stop index should be 4.

To set a large number of colors, send multiple api calls of 256 colors at a time.<br>
`{"seg": {"i":[0,'CC0000', '00CC00', '0000CC', 'CC0000'...]}}` <br>
`{"seg": {"i":[256, 'CC0000', '00CC00', '0000CC', 'CC0000'...]}}`<br>
`{"seg": {"i":[512, 'CC0000', '00CC00', '0000CC', 'CC0000'...]}}`<br>
Note that the number of instructions possible in one api call is dependant on several things. 
1. Your device. A more powerfull device can handle more instructions at the same time
2. Your device current load. I.e. running peek when uploading will reduce the number of instructions the device can handle
3. Your instructions. I.e HEX color codes will use less resources that DEC and thus more instructions can be handled.
4. Your composition and addressing type. I.e. If you have a checkers board or dotted line typ pattern where you need to change color every led, it will be much harder on the device than if you have large ranges of colors you want to set. In practise you might not be able to set more that 150 individual LEDs in the checkers scenario, but thousands if you have really large segments like 500 red, leds, then 500 green leds, and so on.

Keep in mind that the LED indices are segment-based, so LED 0 is the first LED of the segment, not of the entire strip.
Segment features, including Grouping, Spacing, Mirroring and Reverse are functional.
This feature is available in build 200829 and above.

Matrices are handled as a non-serpentine layout.

!!! info "Brightness interaction"
    For your colors to apply correctly, make sure the desired brightness is set beforehand. Turning on the LEDs from an off state and setting individual LEDs in the same JSON request will _not_ work!

#### Playlists

(Available since 0.11.0)

Sample playlist API call:

```json
{
  "playlist": {
    "ps": [26, 20, 18, 20],
    "dur": [30, 20, 10, 50],
    "transition": 0,
    "repeat": 10,
    "end": 21
  }
}
```

This example applies preset ID 26 for 3 seconds, then preset 20 for 2 seconds, then preset 18 for 1 second, lastly preset 20 again for 5 seconds.This repeats 10 times, then preset 21 is applied.

Playlist object:

| JSON key | Description
| --- | --- |
ps | Array of preset ID integers to be applied in this order.
dur | Array of time each preset should be kept, in tenths of seconds. If only one integer is supplied, all presets will be kept for that time.Defaults to 10 seconds if not provided.
transition | Array of time each preset should transition to the next one, in tenths of seconds. If only one integer is supplied, all presets will transition for that time. Defaults to the current transition time if not provided.
repeat | How many times the entire playlist should cycle before finishing. Set to `0` for an indefinite cycle. Default to indefinite if not provided.
end | Single preset ID to apply after the playlist finished. Has no effect when an indefinite cycle is set. If not provided, the light will stay on the last preset of the playlist.

#### Light capabilities

In order to e.g. only show color controls relevant to a given setup, it is necessary to obtain the color capabilities of the light.  
The `info.leds.seglc` array can be used to do so on a per-segment level. It contains `n+1` 8-bit integers, where `n` is the `id` of the last _active_ segment,
each index corresponds to the segment with that ID.  
This integer indicates whether a given segment supports (24 bit) RGB colors, an extra (8 bit) white channel and/or adjustable color temperature (CCT):  

| Bit | Capability
| --- | --- |
0 | Segment supports RGB color
1 | Segment supports white channel
2 | Segment supports color temperature
3-7 | Reserved (expect any value)

Therefore:  

| `lc` value | Capabilities
| --- | --- |
0 | None. Indicates a segment that does not have a bus within its range, e.g. because it is not active.
1 | Supports RGB
2 | Supports white channel only
3 | Supports RGBW
4 | Supports CCT only, no white channel (unused)
5 | Supports CCT + RGB, no white channel (unused)
6 | Supports CCT (including white channel) 
7 | Supports CCT (including white channel) + RGB

Note that CCT is controllable per-segment, while RGB color and white channel have 3 color slots each per segment.  
  
`info.leds.lc` contains this info on a global level, and is a bitwise AND of the per-segment light capability values.  

#### CCT control

Please also see the [general info about CCT](/features/cct).
##### Supported value ranges

Given that the white spectrum handling is agnostic to the true color temperature of the LEDs used, a relative range is preferred for the time being, where a value of `0` indicates the warmest possible color temperature, while a value of `255` indicates the coldest temperature.

It is also possible to pass a value in the range of `1900` to `10091`, in which case it is treated as a Kelvin color temperature, where `1900` is mapped to a relative value of `0` and `10091` to a relative value of `255`.

As such, it is unlikely to match the _actual_ color temperature output by the light, therefore the relative values 0-255 are preferred for the time being.

In the future, an option to specify the Kelvin temperatures of the utilized hardware may be added, once this is done, a color temperature can be set to more accurately match other lights.

Therefore, for forward compatibility, your integration should expect both either a 0-255 value for `seg.cct`, in which case it is a relative value, or an absolute Kelvin value in the range 1000-16000 K. In case a Kelvin value is provided, you can consider the color temperature as accurate, which is not possible with relative 0-255 values as the Kelvin points of the white channels are unknown.  
It is preferred that you set a new CCT value in the same range as received from WLED, that is, use 0-255 if the original value was within this range, and 1000-20000 K otherwise.

If your code relies on absolute Kelvin values, a reasonable estimate for the warm white point (relative `0`) could be 2700K, while cold white (relative `255`) could commonly be 6500K.

##### Effect of the seg.cct value

`seg.cct` can always be set, but only has an effect on the physical state of the light if one or both of the following conditions is met:

- White Balance correction is enabled
- A bus supporting CCT is configured and `Calculate CCT from RGB` is _not_ enabled

CCT support is indicated by `info.leds.cct` being `true`, in which case you can regard the instance as a CCT light and e.g. display a color temperature control.

#### Effect metadata

!!! tip "Why effect metadata?"
    Prior to 0.14, user interfaces showed Speed and Intensity slider, palette controls, and all three color slots regardless of the effect selected.
    This may cause confusion to the user because controls are displayed that have no immediate effect in the current configuration.
    Effect metadata allows you to dynamically hide certain controls, so that the user only sees controls actually utilized by the selected effect mode.

Starting with WLED 0.14, effect metadata is available under the `/json/fxdata` URL.  
This returns an array of strings with `info.fxcount` entries.
The string at a given index corresponds to the metadata of the effect with the same ID as that index.
Metadata is stored in a memory-optimized string format, for example the Aurora effect has the metadata `!,!;;!;1;sx=24,pal=50`.

The metadata string consists of up to five sections, separated by semicolons:
`<Effect parameters>;<Colors>;<Palette>;<Flags>;<Defaults>`

##### Effect parameters

The first section specifies the number and labels of effect parameters (e.g. speed, intensity).
Up to 5 sliders and 3 checkboxes are supported (`sx`,`ix`,`c1`,`c2`,`c3`,`o1`,`o2`,`o3` parameters in the `seg` object).
Slider/checkbox labels are comma separated.
An empty or missing label disables this control.
`!` specifies the default label is used:

| Parameter | Default tooltip label
| --- | --- |
sx | Effect speed
ix | Effect intensity
c1 | Custom 1
c2 | Custom 2
c3 | Custom 3
o1 | Option 1
o2 | Option 2
o3 | Option 3

The fallback value if this section is missing is two sliders, Effect speed and Effect intensity.

Examples:  

| Parameter string | Displayed controls
| --- | --- |
`<empty>` | No effect parameters
! | 1 slider: Effect speed
!,! | 2 sliders: Effect speed + Effect intensity
!,Phase | 2 sliders: Effect speed + Phase
,Saturation,,,,Invert | 1 slider (sets `ix` parameter) and 1 checkbox: Saturation + Invert
,,,,,Random colors | 1 checkbox: Random colors

##### Colors

Up to 3 colors can be used. Please note that only the first two characters of the label are visible in the WLED UI.  
`!` specifies the default label is used. The default labels for the color slots are `Fx`, `Bg`, and `Cs`.

The fallback value if this section is missing is 3 colors: `Fx` + `Bg` + `Cs`.

Examples:  

| Colors string | Displayed controls
| --- | --- |
`<empty>` | No color controls
! | 1 color: Fx
,! | 1 color: Bg
!,! | 2 colors: Fx + Bg
1,2,3 | 3 colors: 1 + 2 + 3

##### Palette

If empty, the effect does not use palettes. If `!`, palette selection is enabled.

The fallback value if this section is missing is palette selection enabled.

##### Flags

Flags allow filtering for effects with certain characteristics.
They are a single character each and not comma-separated.
Currently, the following flags are specified:

| Flag | Effect characteristic
| --- | --- |
0 | Effect works well on a single LED. If flag 0 is present, flags 1/2/3 are omitted. (unused)
1 | Effect is optimized for use on 1D LED strips.
2 | Effect requires a 2D matrix setup (unless flag 1 is also present)
3 | Effect requires a 3D cube (unless flags 1 and/or 2 are also present) (unused)
v | Effect is audio reactive, reacts to amplitude/volume.
f | Effect is audio reactive, reacts to audio frequency distribution.

For example, a Flag string of `2v` denotes a volume reactive effect that is to be used on 2D matrices.

The fallback value if this section is missing is `1`, i.e. a 1D optimized effect.

##### Defaults

Defaults are values for effect parameters that work particularly well on that effect.
They are set automatically when the effect is loaded.
To specify defaults, use the standard segment parameter name (e.g. `ix`) followed by an `=` and the default value.
For example, `sx=24,pal=50` sets the effect speed to 24 (slow) and the palette to ID 50 (Aurora).

If no default is specified for a given parameter, it retains the current value.

### Sensors

!!! warning
    This section about the Sensor API is a DRAFT specification. It is not yet implemented and subject to change.

Various types of sensors (e.g. for Temperature, light intensity, PIR) may be added to WLED via usermods.
To allow read access to sensor data via the JSON API in a standardized way, the `info.sensor` array is used.

If the `info.sensor` array is missing or empty, no sensor values are exposed.

#### Sensor object

Each sensor/measurement is represented by an object within the `info.sensor` array.

For example,

```json
{"type":"T","n":"Outside","val":12}
```

refers to a 12 °C temperature measurement in Celsius with the sensor name "Outside".

The object may contain the following properties, of which all are optional, except `type`.

| JSON key | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
type | string | The type of the sensor.
n | string | The name of the sensor. If omitted, the client may generate a suitable name (e.g. "Temperature sensor 1") 
val | any | The most current sensor reading. May be of any JSON type depending on the type of the sensor, this is a number for all sensor types pre-defined below except for the `"b"` and `"CL"` types and custom type sensors. `null` if the reading is invalid, either due to an error or because the first reading has not yet completed.
unit | string | An explicit human-readable unit string for the measurement. If omitted, the default for the sensor type is used.
error | int or string | If present and not `null`,`false`,`0` or an empty string, a sensor error is indicated. May either be an integer error code or an error string.
tc | number | Seconds of WLED `uptime` when the value last changed substantially. The threshold for a "substantial" change is up to the implementation. This can for example be used to find when a PIR sensor was last activated. 
tm | number | Seconds of WLED `uptime` when the last reading given by `val` was obtained.
ts | number | Seconds of WLED `uptime` at the first measurement / start of measurement period. (required for Energy sensor type)
min | number | Lower bound of possible value range
max | number | Upper bound of possible value range
u | number | Absolute uncertainty of the measurement
model | string | Identification of the sensor hardware used

#### Sensor types

These are the standardized sensor types that may be implemented by usermods:

| Type ID string | Measurement type | Default unit
| --- | --- | --- |
"" (empty string) | Invalid sensor (reserved) | - 
b | Button/Boolean | true/false
c | Custom user-defined sensor | -
q | Electric charge | As
t | Time | s
BL| Battery Level | %
CL| 24-bit RGB color | hex string
E | Energy (`ts` property required) | J
I | Electric current | A
J | Illuminance | lx
L | Distance | m
Lp| Sound pressure level | dB
M | Mass | kg
N | Number/count | -
P | Power | W
Pe| General purpose percentage | %
PL| Power Level (signal strength) | dBm
Pr| Pressure | Pa
R | Electric Resistance | Ohms
RH| Relative Humidity | %
T | Temperature | °C
U | Voltage | V
(other strings) | Reserved, let us know if you need a new type added | -

If a client is only interested in certain sensor types (e.g. Temperature), it may disregard all other sensor objects.
