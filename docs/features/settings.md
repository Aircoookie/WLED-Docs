Web-configurable settings are split in multiple sub-pages. This page is meant to clarify the purpose of each setting.

## WiFi Settings

This sub-page offers options to connect the ESP to different WiFi/WLAN devices. (This section applies to WLED 0.8.5.)

WiFi sleep | Y/N | Disabling WiFi sleep can increase reliability, but increases power consumption

## LED Preferences

This sub-page configures your LED & Hardware setup. (This section applies to WLED 0.14.1.)

| Setting name | Value Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Enable automatic brightness limiter | on/off | on | Have WLED automatically reduce overall brightness so that maximum current draw from the power supply stays below a specified level
Maximum current | 300–65000 mA | 850 mA | Maximum allowable current draw that WLED will target [*only appears if "Enable automatic brightness limiter" is on*]
LED voltage | multiple options | "5V default (55mA)" | Voltage/type of LEDs [*only appears if "Enable automatic brightness limiter" is on*]
Custom max. current | 1–255 | 50 | Current draw of a single LED pixel set to full white [*only appears if "LED voltage" is set to "Custom"*]

### Hardware Setup

#### LED outputs

WLED supports multiple outputs. To add an output, click the plus button at the bottom of the "LED outputs": section; to remove the last output, click the minus button. Bellow the plus/minus buttons is an indication of how much of the memory allocated to LEDs is being used by the configuration.

All outputs share the same address space within WLED. By default, the first pixel of an output will be given an address that is one higher than the last pixel of the previous output, but this can be altered.

Each output has the following settings:

| Setting name | Value Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Type (represented by the output's number) | multiple options | WS281x | Select the type of LEDs this output will be controlling
Clock | multiple options | "Normal" | Select the PWM frequency used when driving analog LEDs <br> Used PWM frequencies for the ESP8266 / ESP32 respectively; <br> Slowest: 293.33 Hz / 6510.33 Hz <br> Slow: 440 Hz / 9765.50 Hz <br> Normal: 880 Hz / 19531 Hz <br> Fast: 1760 Hz / 39062 Hz <br> Fastest: 	2640 Hz / 58593 Hz <br> [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports PWM dimming*]
Color order | muliple options | "GRB" | Select which order your LEDs process color information (e.g. if your LEDs display red and green swapped, try changing it) [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports color order*]
Start/Index | integer | cummulative length of all previous outputs | Define which address this output (or its first pixel) should use within WLED's address space [*only editable if "Custom bus start indices" is on*]
Length | integer | 1 | Define how many pixels are connected to this output [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports multiple pixels*]
(Data/Clk) GPIO(s) | integer | (blank) | Tell WLED which GPIO pin(s) this output is connected to [*number and description of GPIO settings will depend on the output's selected type*]
Reversed (rotated 180°) | on/off | off | Mirrors the LEDs (last LED is first) [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports multiple pixels*]
Skip first LEDs | 0–length | 0 | Will turn off the first one or more LEDs and shift those remaining by that number (e.g. if the first LEDs are only used as a signal repeater) [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports multiple pixels*]
Off Refresh | on/off | off (typically) | WLED doesn't send out data if all of its outputs are off, but some pixels (notably TM1814) will go into a demo mode after a period of inactivity, and setting forces WLED to periodically send out additional "off" commands [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports multiple pixels; default is "on" if "Type" is set to "TM1814"*]
Inverted output | on/off | off | Invert the output's state (i.e. if the output is bright when it's supposed to be dark, set this to "on") [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports output inversion*]
IP address | IPv4 | (blank) | Set the IP address where the output data should be sent to [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that supports network output*]
Auto-calculate white chanel from RGB | multiple options | "None" | Selects whether WLED should attempted to generate white-channel information for colors that are only defined as red, green, and blue values [*only appears if "Type" is set to a type that has more than three color channels*]

The following settings apply to all LED outputs:

| Setting name | Value Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Make a segment for each output | on/off | off | Will automatically create a segment for each output, including the correct Start LED and Stop LED settings
Custom bus start indices | on/off | off| When on, custom "Start" or "Index" values can be set for each output (e.g. output 2 can be set so that it shows up as LED address 200 regardless of output 1's length)
Use global LED buffer | on/off | on | Improves the performance of WLED-wide brightness controlls (including Automatic Brightness Limiting) at the expense of additional memory usage

Additionally, one or more Color Order Overrides can be defined by clicking the plus button. This is useful when you have LEDs with two different color orders sharing the same output. The following settings are available for each override:

| Setting name | Value Range | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Start | integer | 0 | Define which address this color override should start it
Length | integer | 1 | Define how many pixels in a row should have their color setting overridden
Color order | muliple options | "GRB" | Same as "Color order" above
