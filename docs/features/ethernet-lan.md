## Introduction

WLED controllers are usually integrated into local network wirelessly (via WiFi). But there is also possibility to integrate WLED Controller into your network via Ethernet (LAN). Currently only ESP32 based controllers support Ethernet (classic, NOT new types like -S2, -C3, -S3 etc.).

## Preconditions and important notes
-	ESP32 based controller with integrated Ethernet or with Ethernet adapter is required.
-	The controller / adapter type must be supported by WLED. The list of supported controllers / adapters can be found below.
-	WLED Software must be compiled with Ethernet support included. Web-based WLED installer have special option for this. Be sure you use right WLED version with Ethernet support.
-	Ethernet requires many GPIOs (see table below). You cannot use them for other purposes at the same time.
-	If you switch from WiFi to Ethernet and you use dynamic (not static) IP addresses via DHCP (that is true in most cases), your WiFi/LAN Router will most likely grant new IP address to the WLED Controller. If you don’t delete WiFi credentials, your Controller will be accessible via WiFi and Ethernet at the same time by two different IP addresses.
-	Ethernet standard requires that the ethernet lines including shield are isolated form the electronics and for EMC reasons a ceramic capacitor (rated for 2 kV) should be connected between Ethernet shield and electronics ground. Unfortunately, many simple/cheap ethernet adapters do not fulfill these requirements. Be careful using them.
-	Most of Ethernet based controllers/ adapters are based on LAN87xx IC. It requires proper reset line. Unfortunately, some simple/cheap adapters do not implement this line correctly that might lead to instabilities especially during boot up.
-	ESP32 can be configured to provide the 50MHz clock for the PHY on GPIO0, GPIO16 or GPIO17. For operation with LAN87xx IC, use GPIO17. If you want to use GPIO0 with LAN87xx, you will need to add an inverter between GPIO0 and the LAN87xx CLKIN pin.
-	If you connect Ethernet adapter via wires, keep them as short as possible. The communication between ESP32 controller and the adapter is on high speed of 50 MHz that requires proper connection to avoid instabilities.

## Ethernet setup
Go to "Config" and then to "WiFi Setup". At the bottom of this page select the Ethernet type you use. Then click on "Save &  Connect". Ready!

## Ethernet controllers and adapters supported by WLED (as of November 2023)
Note: all controllers use GPIOs 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27 as they are required for ethernet and can not be changed. GPIOs additionally used are given in the table.

## Defining GPIO for a custom PCBA

The following PHY are supported by WLED according to the header ETH.h:
[LAN8720](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/lan8720a)
[TLK110](https://www.ti.com/product/TLK110)
[IP101](https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2206021645_WIZNET-IP101GRI_C910373.pdf)

The source code also mentions ETH_PHY_MAX but this is not enough information to link to a specific part

If you want to add an additional board type including custom GPIO allocations to the UI, you will need to modify the following source files before compiling WLED using default_envs = esp32_eth in platformio.ini:
| File | Line (approx) | Description |
|---|---|---|
const.h | 288 | increment WLED_NUM_ETH_TYPES
const.h | 301 | add a #define for your board with the next available index after the list of existing boards
network.cpp | 119 | add an aditional initialisation for your board type
settings_wifi.htm | 221 | add your board name and enum index


note that you will need to recompile the html, see [Changing web UI for instruction](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Add-own-functionality/a30b2f3004c9aafc0639138afbff73b4efe4a766)
