We've had a lot of fun creating our audio reactive fork of WLED, and we've got more to come.

## Wish List
| Topic  | Notes | Skills Required |
| ------------- | ------------- |-- |
| ✔️ Dynamic sliders/controls | Allow additional sliders to be hidden by default, or displayed depending on the effect.  | Javascript, XML, JSON, HTML, CSS |
| ✔️ Improved default values for sliders | Allow improved default values for sliders and on a per SEGMENT basis. | Javascript, XML, JSON, HTML |
| Add 2D Library support | Add a full 2D library for FastLED functionality | C, System |
| ✔️ Add SEGMENT support for 2D | Improve SEGMENT capabilities | Everything |
| Improved/documented QA process | We need to be able to better test our significant updates. A test/release plan would be a good start. | ITIL
| Coordinated light show | To have delayed/coordinated lighting effects in different devices. To run on Android.| Kotlin (for Android), C
| Multi-pin | To support SR WLED with SEGMENTS and multi-pin
|per-device squelch + gain | see https://github.com/atuline/WLED/issues/221 <br /> for users who configure several sound inputs (use one at a time) it might be useful to have squelch/gain settings for each device.| C++

Our focus for new functionality should be specific to sound reactivity. Otherwise, we should get some idea as to if/when AirCoookie is planning to implement this functionality.
