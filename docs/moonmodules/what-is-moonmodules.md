WLED AC 0.14 = (WLED AC 0.13 + WLED SR)(2.0). 
WLED SR is for the last 2 years maintained mainly by @softhack007 and @ewowi. 
WLED AC 0.14 has been made mainly by @Aircoookie , @blazoncek , @softhack007 and @ewowi. 

WLED MM is mainly maintained by @softhack007 and @ewowi and can be considered similar to what AMG is doing to Mercedes (see http://amg.wled.me/). It is compatible with WLED AC (it's running on average only 1 day to 1 week behind WLED AC latest build). Consider WLED MM as a possible next version of WLED AC (we submit PR's on a regular basis). The reason WLED MM is created is that we have many ideas how to improve WLED AC but we need a playground to develop those ideas. When they are ready for mass production they can be adopted in WLED AC.
