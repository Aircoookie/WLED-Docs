!!! info "These are only defaults"
    All pins can be changed in the Hardware section of LED settings. Please note that these are GPIO numbers, please consult a pinout for your board to find the labeled pin (e.g `D4` = `GPIO2` on most ESP8266 boards). When using an ESP8266 board, it's recommended to use pins `GPIO1`, `GPIO2`, or `GPIO3` for LED Data; using other pins will require _bit-banging_ and may cause slow performance and/or issues elsewhere (such as with IR decoding).
