Currently (as of summer 2023) only the microcontrollers from Espressif, types ESP8266 and ESP32 (with dual core) are fully supported. Some of the newer types like ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 are experimentally supported, but productive use is not recommended yet because some bugs are suspected. In addition, the installation of these newer types is not that easy: there are several hardware variations/boards for which the SW must be specially compiled. It should also be mentioned that some ESP32-C3 boards (so-called C3 mini V1.0.0) are still being sold on the market where WLAN does not work properly.

To try out WLED with 5V addressable strip a simple microcontroller board like ESP8266 D1 mini or ESP32 D1 mini is sufficient. The simplest setup might be like:
![Simple WLED setup](../assets/images/content/pic10.jpg)

However, there are a few other things to keep in mind for a proper setup:

  1. A level shifter is required for reliable data transmission from the controller to the LED strip (this is mandatory, especially with 12V or 24V LED strips). Then you have to solder something together or you can buy a ready-made WLED controller right away.
  2. For safety reasons, the correct cabling (length, cross-section, contacts) and the fuses to be integrated must be considered. Especially with LED strips, it gets more complicated because you need the so-called intermediate feeds. These must be planned and implemented correctly. [LED power, wiring and fuse calculator](https://wled-calculator.github.io/) can be used as an starting point.
  ![Advanced WLED setup](../assets/images/content/pic11.jpg)
  3. LED strips can get quite warm during operation and even overheat in the event of a fault. Again, for safety reasons, you have to protect the area around it: you shouldn't just lay LED strips like that, ideally you should integrate them into aluminum profiles or something similar. In normal operation, these act like a heat sink and thus extend the service life of the LEDs. In the event of a fault, they can protect the surroundings.
  4. To save energy while LEDs are off, you might integrate relays that switch the voltage of LEDs off completely.

In the following some third-party controllers are listed. Please use a decent and neutral description when adding things to this list.

I/O configuration: LEDPIN is 'GPIO19' for addressable LEDs, BTNPIN is GPIO 3. PWM pin out for RGBWW: WW: 4, CW: 5, R: 10, G: 6 and B: 7. Level shifter used: SN74HCT245 - Warning, the flash is *encrypted* - be sure to specify the `-encrypt` flag when flashing with `esptool.py`. Each device has a unique flash encryption key, but the devs forgot to burn the 'disable UART download' efuse, which means that any non-encrypted firmware can be flashed onto the device, and the device will encrypt the firmware on the first boot. Before flashing, please back up the original firmware of the device with esptool.py `esptool.py read_flash 0 0x400000 sp530e-encrypted.bin`. Pics of board and the flashing connector here: <https://imgur.com/a/0orUKF1> -  Sample flashing command: `esptool.py write_flash --encrypt 0x0 C3_bootloader.bin 0x8000 C3_partitions_4M.bin 0x10000 WLED_0.15.0-b3_ESP32C3_4MB.bin`.

## Raw ESP8266/ESP32 boards

!!! tip
    While these can work like the controllers above without extra hardware, you might get flickering without adding an external levelshifter. Using them without a controller board/shield is only recommended if you like tinkering with electronic projects.

| Name | Chip | Description |
|---|---|---|
[Adafruit Feather Huzzah](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266) | ESP8266 | General-purpose ESP8266 Board with USB, battery connector, etc.
[D1 mini-style ESP32](https://acrobotic.com/products/acr-00024) | ESP32 | A nice compact ESP32 development board. D1 mini compatible layout.
ESP-01 | ESP8266 | One of the first and cheapest ESP8266 boards available. **_Not recommended for general WLED installs_** (needs external USB/serial chip, voltage converter, only has 1mb of flash, so soon no wireless updates possible)
[ESP32 DevKitC v4](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/1965-1000-ND/9356990) | ESP32 | The original ESP32 Development Board made by Espressif Systems.
[ESP32-C3 Super Mini](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805781327184.html) | ESP32-C3 | Very compact, easy to flash with the USB-C port, can support 3A over the USB-C connector. Extremely cheap, but only has one core so there's a small stutter during Wifi communication. [Be careful purchasing! Some stores sell a version that has crippling Wifi strength issues.](https://roryhay.es/blog/esp32-c3-super-mini-flaw)
