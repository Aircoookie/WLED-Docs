Currently (as of summer 2023) only the microcontrollers from Espressif, types ESP8266 and ESP32 (with dual core) are fully supported. Some of the newer types like ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 are experimentally supported, but productive use is not recommended yet because some bugs are suspected. In addition, the installation of these newer types is not that easy: there are several hardware variations/boards for which the SW must be specially compiled. It should also be mentioned that some ESP32-C3 boards (so-called C3 mini V1.0.0) are still being sold on the market where WLAN does not work properly.

To try out WLED with 5V addressable strip a simple microcontroller board like ESP8266 D1 mini or ESP32 D1 mini is sufficient. The simplest setup might be like:
![Simple WLED setup](../assets/images/content/pic10.jpg)

However, there are a few other things to keep in mind for a proper setup:
1. A level shifter is required for reliable data transmission from the controller to the LED strip (this is mandatory, especially with 12V or 24V LED strips). Then you have to solder something together or you can buy a ready-made WLED controller right away.
2. For safety reasons, the correct cabling (length, cross-section, contacts) and the fuses to be integrated must be considered. Especially with LED strips, it gets more complicated because you need the so-called intermediate feeds. These must be planned and implemented correctly. [LED power, wiring and fuse calculator](https://wled-calculator.github.io/) can be used as an starting point.
![Advanced WLED setup](../assets/images/content/pic11.jpg)
3. LED strips can get quite warm during operation and even overheat in the event of a fault. Again, for safety reasons, you have to protect the area around it: you shouldn't just lay LED strips like that, ideally you should integrate them into aluminum profiles or something similar. In normal operation, these act like a heat sink and thus extend the service life of the LEDs. In the event of a fault, they can protect the surroundings.
4. To save energy while LEDs are off, you might integarte relays that switch the voltage of LEDs off completely.

In the following some third-party controllers are listed. Please use a decent and neutral description when adding things to this list.

## Controllers WLED can be installed to

!!! warning
    If the controller does not have a USB port and no firmware supporting wireless updates pre-installed, installing WLED to it requires an FTDI flasher and in some cases, soldering.

| Name | Chip | Description |
|---|---|---|
[ESPixelStick v3](https://forkineye.com/espixelstick-v3/) | ESP8266 | The ESPixelStick V3 is a WiFi Pixel and DMX single output controller built around the ESP8266 platform. It utilizes industry standard E1.31 sACN and DDP protocols for control of up to 680 WS2811 pixels (4 Universes) or 63 GECE Pixels.  The output passes through a built-in RS485 transceiver, allowing for driving DMX and differential Renard inputs (or using a differential receiver for long-distance between board and first pixel). The on board switching regulator allows you to power the ESPixelStick with 5V-24V -- Just match the voltage of the pixels you are using, no voltage configuration is required.  Note: Does _**not**_ come preconfigured with WLED, you must flash the ESP8266 yourself.
[SP108e v2](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07KW1W68R) | ESP8285 | Hardware-Modification required and different versions exists! 8285-based 2M Controller that supports addressable RGBWW LED strips, also with CLK line (like ATA102). 5-24v DC input, 85mm x 45mm x 23mm. Vendors list spledapps 'Led Shop' as the supporting mobile application. Board is silk screened with 'SP108e'. No pads are exposed and a second processor is used to control the LEDs. Pin7 of that processor needs to be grounded to hold it in reset state. Then you can connect GPIO0 to GND and TX, RX, VCC, GND for flashing. Connect GPIO2 to R4 for DATA out and GPIO13 to R3 for CLK out. Flashed via PlatformIO, esptool. OTA updates work. Pics of pinout here: <https://github.com/psxde/sp108e-led-controller/raw/main/sp108ev2_inside.png>
SP501e | ESP8285 | 8285-based 1M Controller that supports both Addressable and PWM-based RGBWW LED strips. _Note that recent versions have 2M._ 5-24v DC input, 55mm x 26mm, sold under BTF lighting, RGBZone, etc. Vendors all list 'Fairynest' as the supporting mobile application. Board is silk screened with 'SP5XXe' but no other markings. Serial pads are exposed on the back-side of the board with GND and GPIO0 right next to each other and thus Flash access fairly straight forward. GPIO 0 must be pulled to GND at boot and throughout the flashing process.  I/O configuration: LEDPIN is 'GPIO3' for addressable (note this pin is limited to approx. 250 LEDs), BTNPIN is GPIO 1. PWM pin out for RGBWW: CW: 14, WW: 12, B: 13, R: 15 and G: 4. Flashed via PlatformIO, ESPHome and Tasmotizer.

[ESP LED Strip WIFI Control Board [ESP Version]](https://www.electrodragon.com/product/esp-led-strip-board) | ESP8266 | Controller for addressable or analog LEDs (RGBW), 6-27VDC input, no level shifter, reset and boot buttons, enclosure. NOTE: Although this uses high-current transistors, they used jumpers on two of the connections so you are limited to their current rating (3A?).

## Raw ESP8266/ESP32 boards

!!! tip
    While these can work like the controllers above without extra hardware, you might get flickering without adding an external levelshifter. Using them without a controller board/shield is only recommended if you like tinkering with electronic projects.
